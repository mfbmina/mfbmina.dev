I'm a software developer/engineer who met Go after years of working with Ruby and fell in love with the language. I wanna write about technologies and subjects that I'm studying, working on, or have some interest in.

Some information about me:
- Staff Software Engineer at PicPay
- From Varginha, Minas Gerais, Brazil
- Technician in Industrial IT on CEFET-MG
- Bachelor in Computer Science on UNIFEI
- I hope that one day I will get a master's degree
- I love dogs, and I have 5 of them
- Muay Thai Practioner
- I can't play any FPS games

I hope that you like my blog, and thank you!
